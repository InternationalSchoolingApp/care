            In the rollercoaster of life, countless individuals find themselves derailed or lost by the obstacles of inaccessible and unaffordable education. This harsh reality not only crushes their hope for a better life but also inflicts deep wounds upon the dreams and aspirations of those seeking knowledge and opportunity.
            <br />
            More often than not, traditional education systems fail to find ways to support students with different learning needs and speeds and create an environment full of restrictions. Especially for physically challenged students and students with special needs, it becomes extremely difficult to learn and respond in a classroom of 30 students. They need extra attention and guidance to match pace with their peers and fulfill their learning needs.
